# RedisResourceMap

COVID-19 Resource Dashboard is a project leveraging the power of Redis Search, RedisGears, and Redis PubSub to create a live-updating, crowdsourced dashboard to connect places with excess supply of masks, oxygen, and vaccines to places lacking in such supplies. Users can add locations to indicate both excess supply and required resources, and the RedisGears matching engine will utilize the power ofRedis Searchgeospatial querying to match up supplies with requirements.

## How data is stored

- Resource and location data are stored as documents in theRedis Searchformat. They contain the fields:
  - masks (Numerical)
  - vaccines (Numerical)
  - oxygen (Numerical)
  - updated (Numerical)
  - coords (Geo)

## How data is processed

- Data is inserted (asRedis Searchdocuments) using the `HSET` command. Details on query construction are abstracted away with the `Redis Search` Python API, but the fields are as mentioned above
- Data is queried using `FT.SEARCH`:
    - Since this uses geospatial querying, heavy use of `GEORADIUS`/geospatial query syntax is used
    - Example query: `FT.SEARCH @coords[long lat radius km] FILTER masks 1 10000 INKEYS 1 -76,40`
- Update are published with PUBLISH and read with SUBSCRIBE
    - New data is processed with RedisGears async jobs, and sent via Redis PubSub on either the `new_data` channel or `match_data` channel (if a resource is matched)
    - Example: `PUBLISH new_data "{masks: 10, ...}"`, `SUBSCRIBE new_data`

## Instructions

- Run the Redis labs RedisModules docker image: `docker run -p 6379:6379 redislabs/redismod`
- Using pip and python 3.7, install the requirements in `requirements.txt`, or create a Conda environment using `conda env create --file conda_env.yml` and then run `conda activate redis` to activate the environment.
- Run `python server.py` from `backend/`.  This will create a server accessible at `localhost:5000`
- Install node.js and npm if you do not already have it installed (see [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)).  Then run `npm install` and `npm start` from `frontend/`, and the React frontend should appear in your web browser at `localhost:3000/admin/dashboard`
